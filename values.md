NIL values being inclusive and diverse. We want to be a space where all sorts of people feel safe. This means that our door are not always open, and we carefully choose who joins us.

NIL exists to enable the quintessential joy of creation. We are here for the passion project. Commercialization and scaling can come later, and elsewhere. We are not an incubator or a coworking space.

Come to NIL to work and to collaborate. Feel free to choose who you work with, but do not be surprised if others start similar projects. Forking is a gesture of love: you own your work, not your ideas.

NIL welcomes all levels of participation; the best way to contribute is by participating. The space is here for you: sitting and working is fine, but you're only really here when here you're here in spirit too. You contribute to the space by contributing to the space, not just by being here.

There is no SLA on quiet time. Hardware work can be loud.

NIL are not here for profit for ourselves, or for others. we are here to maintain & enable this space, to improve this space, and to share it's values

NIL welcomes those of all skill levels and abilities. It is not for us to decide who is “really” hacking. As long as your project follows the golden rule, you may work on it here.

NIL believes in freedom and openness: free software, open culture, and sharing. Openness respects and values the privacy of other people. Freedom acknowledges the impact one's actions has on others, and respects their autonomy.
