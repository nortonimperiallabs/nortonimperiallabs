======================
An imperial proclamation for creative collaboration

Norton Imperial Laboratories exists to provide a space where interesting people collaborate to write on the world in the ink of their imagination.

NIL strives to inspire collaboration, creativity, and passion in the San Francisco community by:

* Fostering an open, collaborative space 
* Providing a safe, clean and inclusive work environment
* Teaching and helping others


Communication
=============

**IRC**: `#sfnil` on Freenode
**Mailing list**: actually a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sfhackerspace)
**Twitter**: [@nil_sf](https://twitter.com/nil_sf)


Meetings
========

We meet every week on Monday at 7pm in cyberspace. Our venue is a Google Hangout. The first person to arrive starts a hangout and pastes the link into the `#sfnil` IRC channel.

Someone takes minutes. The note-taker should put the minutes in a `minutes/yyyy-mm-dd` branch of this repo, and make a pull request. Everyone at the meeting should read the minutes, and note their approval in the pull request. If there's an error, clone the repo/branch and make the fix. Action items should turn into [issues](https://github.com/nortonimperiallabs/doocracy) on the `doocracy` repo.

[The agenda for next week's meeting](http://wiki.nortonimperiallabs.org/next-meeting-agenda) has a permanent place on the wiki. For something to be elegible for a decision at a meeting, the topic must have been added to the agenda by midnight the Friday before.

If a decision requires a change to our processes or whatnot, it needs a pull request. During a meeting, we can agree on a PR, suggest improvements, or reject the proposal. If we agree on a PR, someone in attendence should merge it after the meeting. If it needs improvement make, those should be made in the same branch, and we can re-evaluate it at the next meeting. If at all possible, those who suggested improvements should engage with the PR.

Decisions at meetings are made by consensus of those present, and effective immediately. Decisions can be overruled by consensus at the next meeting. Quorum for a meeting is 3 people.

* * * * *

Our general records of meetings, processes, and whatnot are in this repo. 

* The `[minutes](https://github.com/nortonimperiallabs/nortonimperiallabs/tree/master/minutes)` directory contains our meeting minutes.
* The `[documents](https://github.com/nortonimperiallabs/nortonimperiallabs/tree/master/documents)` directory contains our processes &c.

We have a separate repo for issues. File issues [here](https://github.com/nortonimperiallabs/doocracy).


Branching & Merging
===================

The `master` branch contains final content. Changes to `master` should be proposed in a pull request, and approved at a meeting.

Generally, you should make changes in a branch of your own fork. If you think that others might need to make improvements to your proposal, you should use a branch on the main repo. Please make sure that proposals are in a branch called something like `branch/proposalname`.
