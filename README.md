sfhackerspace
=============

TL;DR: It's a new hackerspace!  Maybe!  If you help!  Exclamation points!

We're interested in starting another general purpose hackerspace in San Francisco.  It would have a classic board/membership model, be located somewhere reasonable to rent and close to transit, and be dedicated to open community hackery of all types.

We have a very excited core of collaboration cohorts constructing our caper.
