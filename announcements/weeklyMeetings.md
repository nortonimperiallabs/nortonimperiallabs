NIL Weekly Meetings
===================

As per 10 Feb meeting, effective 17 Feb we will be having a weekly meeting for the indefinite future.  Our temporarypermanent (as in, until we have our own space) 4dlocation will be **Runway (midmarket SF) at 19:00 on Mondays (subject to change)**.  Food is always on the agenda.

Reminders with agendas will be posted to the mailing list every week, with more detailed points-of-contact than here.  

Directions when you're there, courtesy of Robbie:

* Runway is at 1355 Market Street, San Francisco, CA, in the Twitter building.
* Enter at the entrance next to Walgreens/next to 9th street, not the entrance below the Twitter sign.
* It looks very different now, but [this is the door](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.777222,-122.41669,3a,90y,139.61h,88.01t/data=%213m4%211e1%213m2%211sFhlf5vpHXjRKuiDxTxPRQw%212e0) you'll enter through.
* Robbie will need to let us up past the lobby, and you may need to flash your ID to security.
