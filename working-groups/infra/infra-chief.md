Infrastructure Chief
====================

The infrastructure working group has selected **@rrix** to be responsible for all our bits and bytes.

The infrastructure chief can independently make decisions about our technical infrastructure. They can make whatever changes are needed, including setting up new software and services or using third-party services. They may make other people responsible for specific pieces of infrastructure, or otherwise delegate decisions and responsibility.

The council has the authority to overrule the decisions of the infrastructure chief.

The chief is reponsible for maintaing a public log of infra decisions and changes.
