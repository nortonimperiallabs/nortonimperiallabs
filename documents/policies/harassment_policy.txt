[Harassment policy stolen from Dragon*Con.]

We value your safety and take pride in _SFHACKERSPACENAMEHERE_ being a safe place where everybody is welcome and anybody can be whomever they desire. As such, certain kinds of offensive or harassing behavior will not be tolerated. To the best of our ability, we intend to eliminate inappropriate conduct from the hackerspace. 

Harassment of any kind, including physically or verbally threatening, annoying, unwelcoming attentions, stalking, pushing, shoving, or use of physical force which in any way creates a disturbance that is disruptive or dangerous, as well as any boisterous, lewd, or generally offensive behavior or language, using sexually explicit or offensive language or conduct, or profanity, obscene gestures, or racial, religious, or ethnic slurs will be considered harassment.

If people tell you NO, your business with them is done. If you continue to attempt to have contact with such people, you may be removed from the premises and your membership revoked.

Remember: “No” means no. “Stop” means stop. “Go away” means go away.

If you feel you have been harassed, please contact a _SFHACKERSPACENAMEHERE_ board member.

If, at any time, you feel that your personal safety or the safety of others is in jeopardy, please contact the San Francisco Police Department in an emergency via 9-1-1 or the SFPD Dispatch at 415-553-8090. The San Francisco Police Department non-emergency phone number is 415-553-0123.
