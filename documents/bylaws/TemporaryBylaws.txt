####### TEMPORARY DECISION STRUCTURE ########

This document will remain in effect until it is superseded by a group-ratified bylaws document.
It outlines the decision-making process of the organization.
The goal of this document is to facilitate short-term progress whilst alleviating awkwardness associated with questions regarding "who is wearing the pants".

As per 03 Mar 2014 meeting minutes:
===================================
 * Discussion on how to handle making permanent decisions until bylaws are ratified
  * *Decree, if you have problems with what happens in a meeting, show up at the next one to change it*
  
SPECIFICALLY:
=============
* Decisions made at weekly group meetings are put into effect immediately (unless otherwise specified) and apply to the whole group.
* For decisions made at weekly group meetings, a minimum of 3 members must be present to establish a quorum.
* If you were absent from a meeting and have concerns with a decision that was made there, show up next week and add it to the agenda during the "summary of previous week" section.  This section comes first, so be on time.
* Decisions made in the process of completing action items from a weekly meeting should generally be considered equivalent to those made in weekly meetings.
