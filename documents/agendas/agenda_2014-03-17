Previous week's summary (10 minutes)
========================

Logistics and Infrastructure
------------

+ For now, if it isn't on the wiki or the NIL repo, it doesn't officially exist
+ Possible (probable?) migration to Discourse
+ Meetings in high-bandwidth digital space (Google Hangouts until proved otherwise)
+ Decisions can only be finalized at meetings
+ Proposals on weekly agenda by 23:59 Friday, then copied to @NIL:NIL/master
	+ If more discussion is needed on a proposal than can fit in the agenda-allotted time, it is automatically tabled to next meeting
	+ Discussion can continue out-of-meeting, but again, any decision is only finalized at a weekly meeting
	+ Decisions cannot be finalized on items that were not on the agenda (minimum required notice)
+ Website autodeployment currently handled by tombot, automation deferred

Decision making
---------------

+ Decisions at weekly meetings apply immediately
+ Any disagreement/discussion can be added to the following agenda
+ Branching is integral part of process
	+ Commits to master are published, decided content
	+ No direct commits to master (should write hook)
	+ Working on something:
		+ Pull request from personal fork for solo work
		+ Private branch on @NIL:NIL for collaborative work
		+ Private branch namespaces: minutes/2014-03-10, proposal/bikeshed, etc
+ Bylaws development will be deferred until more necessary, EX: when board is being formed	
+ RRIX is chief of infrastructure for now and may make infrastructure decisions independent of weekly meetings
	+ These decisions are accountable to RRIX
	+ May be addressed at meetings, etc
	
Action item updates (10 minutes)
=================================================

+ Merlin to figure out how to get persistent URLs for hangouts
+ specific wording for the proposal workflow and procedures for bringing items to the meetings
