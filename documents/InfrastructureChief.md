Chief of Infrastructure
=======================

Codified position:

+ RRIX is chief of infrastructure for now and may make infrastructure decisions independent of weekly meetings
	+ These decisions take effect immediately
	+ RRIX is accountable to the weekly meetings for these decisions and they may decide to override them or make recommendations, etc
	+ RRIX must keep a publicly-viewable record of these decisions in a @NIL repo (preferably on a private branch in @NIL/NIL? depends what infrastructure?)
	+ Infrastructure topics brought up at weekly meetings must still be on the agenda
	+ The council/board may (but hopefully won't need to) elect to replace RRIX at a weekly meeting
