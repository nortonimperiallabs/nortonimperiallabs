Norton Imperial Laboratories (NIL) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, or language. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form.

Harassment includes
* offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, or language;
* deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; 
* unwanted intrusion into an individual's personal items or computer systems; 
* sustained disruption of talks or other events, persistent uninvited communication, or repeated interruption; 
* repeated violation of an individual's stated boundaries, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention in any form.

This is not an exhaustive list of bad behavior. If you are creative enough, you may find other ways to harass or intimidate others. Just because some other form of harassment isn't on this list doesn't change the fact that it's unacceptable.

Different users of NIL have different levels of comfort about sex and pornography. Nobody should be forced to experience sexual or sexualised language or imagery. This does not mean that such material is always prohibited, but that such conversations, presentations, &c. should include only interested and consenting people.

When you are working on a sex- or porn-related project at NIL, or are running such an event or presentation, it is your responsibility to provide reasonable notice and warning to allow others the opportunity to opt out if they wish. With this — as anything else — each person has a responsibility to be considerate of the comfort levels of others. Discussions, projects, and events of this nature should strive to exist in a culture of respect and consent.

This code of conduct applies not only in the physical NIL space, but also in virtual spaces associated with NIL, such as forums or instant-messaging channels. It also applies to NIL-related events which are not held in a NIL space, and to behavior and interactions between members of the NIL community even if they do not occur in NIL-related spaces or at NIL-related events

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Any NIL member may expel any other person if they believe that person has failed to comply with this policy or behave in a respectful manner. If a NIL member chooses to expel a person, that decision is immediately effective no matter the circumstances. If it is believed that a NIL member has expelled someone in error, that decision may be appealed to the NIL community working group, but it does not change the fact that the person asked to leave must immediate leave.

The NIL community working group will respond to reports of harassment or other anti-social behavior and issue appropriate sanction.
