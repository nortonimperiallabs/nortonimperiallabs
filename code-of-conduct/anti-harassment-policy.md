Norton Imperial Laboratories (NIL) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, or language. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, or language, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, persistent uninvited communication, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

Different users of NIL have different levels of comfort about sex and pornography. Nobody should be forced to experience sexual or sexualised language or imagery. This does not mean that such material is always prohibited, but that such conversations, presentations, &c. should include only interested and consenting people.

When you are working on a sex- or porn-related project at NIL, or are running such an event or presentation, it is your responsibility to provide reasonable notice and warning to allow others the opportunity to opt out if they wish. With this — as anything else — each person has a responsibility to be considerate of the comfort levels of others. Discussions, projects, and events of this nature should strive to exist in a culture of respect and consent.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

This code of conduct applies not only in the physical NIL space, but also in virtual spaces associated with NIL, such as forums or instant-messaging channels. It also applies to NIL-related events which are not held in a NIL space, and to behavior and interactions between members of the NIL community even if they do not occur in NIL-related spaces or at NIL-related events

Violations of these rules will lead to immediate expulsion from the space at the discretion of any Norton Imperial Laboratories Member. The NIL community working group will respond to reports of harassment or other anti-social behavior and issue appropriate sanction.
